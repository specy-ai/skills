# Decision Tests

Run these 4 tests **in sequence** on every element you are about to emit. If any test fails, apply the indicated action instead.

## Test 1 — "Is it real?"

> Can I point to a line of source code that evidences this element?

- **Yes** → proceed to Test 2.
- **No** → **do not emit**. Never invent logic absent from code.

## Test 2 — "Is it domain?"

> Would this element still exist if we swapped the technical stack (framework, database, transport)?

- **Yes** (business calculation, domain rule, business status) → proceed to Test 3.
- **No** (password hashing, MIME validation, rate limiting, caching, logging, token storage, metrics) → **omit** with `// NOTE: {description} (infrastructure)`.

### Grey-zone heuristic

If the result affects an entity field via `sets` or conditions the flow via `fails`, it is domain. Otherwise it is likely infrastructure.

## Test 3 — "Is it faithful?"

> Does the expression I am about to write accurately reflect the actual condition in the code?

- **Yes** → proceed to Test 4.
- **No, but the rule is not business-critical** → **omit** with `// NOTE`.
- **No, and the rule is business-critical** → emit `// UNCLEAR: {full business rule description} ({why unexpressible})`.

### Common faithfulness traps

| Trap | Why it fails | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `field is defined` on a required/immutable field (in `fails` or `must`) | Always true → tautology | Use the real condition or `// UNCLEAR` |
| `now() - Entity.createdAt > 5` | No duration operator → ambiguous | `// UNCLEAR` with business rule |
| Status check masking a cross-aggregate rule | Real condition involves another aggregate | Model the cross-aggregate lookup or `// UNCLEAR` |
| Placeholder `when { totalAmount > 0 }` for fraud check | Real logic is an external API call | `// NOTE` (infrastructure) |

## Test 4 — "Is it the right construct?"

> Am I placing this element in the correct Specy construct type?

| Element is... | Correct construct |
|---|---|
| Has identity + mutable lifecycle | `entity` |
| No identity, immutable, equality by content | `value` |
| Fixed set of named constants | `enum` |
| Input DTO triggering a write | `command` |
| Record of something that happened | `event` |
| Stateless class with business logic | `service` (in `.flow`) |
| Persistence interface for aggregate root | `repository` (in `.flow`) |
| Handler for a command → write operation | `interaction` (command-triggered) |
| Handler for an event → side effects | `interaction` (event-triggered) |
| Cross-cutting rule spanning multiple operations | `policy` |
| Structural constraint always true for an entity | `invariant` (entities only, never commands/events/values) |
